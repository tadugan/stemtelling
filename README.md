### System Requirements


Make sure you have the following software installed on your computer or server:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [PostrgeSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/)

### Creating database and tables

This app uses PostgreSQL for all of its database.
The core database is named `stemtelling_database`

```html
SQL code for the tables is in <database.sql>;
```

### Development Setup

- Run `npm install`
- Create a `.env` file at the root of the project and paste this line into the file:
  ```
  SERVER_SESSION_SECRET=superDuperSecret
  NODEMAILER_USER=GmailLogin
  NODEMAILER_PASS=GmailPassword
  CLOUDINARY_NAME=stemtelling
  CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=773161645471824
  CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=isRkBv2rO_wyjy93sX1Lq0b0PTc
  TEACHER_CODE=IAmATeacher
  ```
  In the `.env` file, replace `superDuperSecret` with a long random string like `25POUbVtx6RKVNWszd9ERB9Bb6` to keep the application secure. You can generate a string from [passwordsgenerator.net](https://passwordsgenerator.net/).
  `NODEMAILER_USER` and `NODEMAILER_PASS` are fields for an email username as password. This is where user password reset emails will come from
- Start postgres if not running already by using `brew services start postgresql`
- Run `npm run server`
